#Describtion
This R-code downloads data about "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), fetchs only mean and standard deviation values and merges this set of data with activity and feature labels. All labels are corresponded to camelcase notation. At the end the result is stored in the file tidy.txt.
